Adding speedUp() and slowDown() to ball, to allow accelerating the velMag
	Ball now accelerates into PlayerCharge's gust
	Ball now decelerates into PlayerTwoTouch's 'lock' (Scaled by velocity so game modes with faster balls don't push him ridiculously far. Maybe they should)

Added graphical effect for PlayerCharge
Fixed power kick flash trail drawing to be fillRect instead of drawLine

Fixed Drawing of PowerKick trails to accommodate the new kicking mechanics
Fixed bug in TwoTouch: He will now choose the direction of shortest rotation when rotating in lock around the ball
Fixed bug in TwoTouch: Will no longer rotate through walls in a lock
Added teamColors array so goals will draw correct colour when Twins are on the field

Gave PlayerTwoTouch more stationary dribble effect in setKicking()
Prep for Twins: Players now contain an array of all players instead of just otherPlayer
				Players have variable slowMo which is set by PlayerNeo when he goes in and out of slowmo
				GameplayState does things by iterating through players array instead of referencing p1 and p2
Added PlayerTwin.
Added Actioncam == 0 functionality

5.30.13:
Added player on player collision sliding in Player.updatePos()
Made PlayerPuffer smaller (300 from 400)
Touching the ball while inflating as Puffer will be a flash kick
	BUG: Possible double tapping, makes ball slower than should be
		MAYBE RESOLVED: Added get and set canBeKicked() methods to Ball, so it can't be kicked by the same player after it's been kicked until it leaves kickrange
						However this might not be a solution. Bug is hard to reproduce sometimes
		NOPE NOT RESOLVED
		ACTUALLY RESOLVED: kickingCoolDown is now a more general purpose flag/variable. PlayerPuffer's is increased when the flash kick goes off.
				However, this cooldown is only paid attention to when puffing up
	BUG: Holding down inflate key allows power kick at max inflation even if not in the inflating state
		RESOLVED:Reaching maximum inflation forces powerKeyReleased()
Prevented double taps by requiring ball to leave kickrange before being able to be kicked by that player again
	BUG: Preventing double taps breaks TwoTouch, who is all about double tapping
		RESOLVED: Added Ball argument to setKick(ball), so player objects can tell the ball if it should respond to their kicks or not. Specifically,
			all players except PlayerTwoTouch prevent double tapping.
