Changelog:

5.31.13
Made Player abstract, made methods update(), isKicking(), setPower(), flashKick(), activatePower() and powerKeyReleased() abstract.

5.30.13:
Added player on player collision sliding in Player.updatePos()
Made PlayerPuffer smaller (300 from 400)
Touching the ball while inflating as Puffer will be a flash kick
	BUG: Possible double tapping, makes ball slower than should be
		MAYBE RESOLVED: Added get and set canBeKicked() methods to Ball, so it can't be kicked by the same player after it's been kicked until it leaves kickrange
						However this might not be a solution. Bug is hard to reproduce sometimes
		NOPE NOT RESOLVED
		ACTUALLY RESOLVED: kickingCoolDown is now a more general purpose flag/variable. PlayerPuffer's is increased when the flash kick goes off.
				However, this cooldown is only paid attention to when puffing up
	BUG: Holding down inflate key allows power kick at max inflation even if not in the inflating state
		RESOLVED:Reaching maximum inflation forces powerKeyReleased()
Prevented double taps by requiring ball to leave kickrange before being able to be kicked by that player again
	BUG: Preventing double taps breaks TwoTouch, who is all about double tapping
		RESOLVED: Added Ball argument to setKick(ball), so player objects can tell the ball if it should respond to their kicks or not. Specifically,
			all players except PlayerTwoTouch prevent double tapping.
