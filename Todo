TODO:

Keyboard Mode for each character? For example
	PlayerTwin: The second twin is a mirror
	PlayerTwoTouch: Holding left or right rotates the Player around the ball
BUG: Changing the size of puffer changes the size of the kick trail when it shouldn't DONE
BUG: Holding ActionButton with Enforcer on wall hammers the sounds DONE
BUG: Reactivating the power on Enforcer by holding down after the wall doesn't sound good MEH
TODO: Give Charge the half and half like stun victims DONE
TODO: Create UpdateCounters method DONE
TODO: Stick direction visual guide
TODO: Visuals for charge's trail
Go through all the code and see if it can be less horrible
	TODO: Organize Player constructor
	More abstract classing: Maybe everyone has buttonpressed and actionbutton2 but just leave it empty if unused.
	render() has submethod drawSpecial()
	Reorganize getColors() so you're not wasting memory making new color objects every frame?
Enforcer: Has to build up momentum – DONE
	TODO: Test Enfocer vs everyone else collision and see what happens
Figure out dashing while against a wall
TODO: Velocity add component scaled by angle coincidence
Ball should decelerate into TwoTouch's lock DONE
	What happens if a ball gets knocked out of TwoTouch's hands? Seems to work
		Test if NORMALKICK, DEFAULTKICK and EXTRAKICK are all the correct values
	What happens if two twotouches both try to lock the ball? Seems to work
BUG: TwoTouch gets stuck to the ball
	Resolved: Ball can be kicked out of TwoTouch's hands
PlayerCharge should bounce off wall? DONE Feels a lot better
PlayerCharge dash chaining DONE (Still in testing)
Ball should accelerate into gust DONE
Should the gust reset if the ball is kicked/the ball bounces? DONE
	Sound Effect for this
Sounds
	Charge Charging DONE
	Charge Dashing DONE
	Charge Gusting DONE
	Enforcer PlayerBumping DONE
	Enforcer Charging DONE
	Enforcer Wallbouncing DONE
	Enforcer Activating DONE
		Needs visual effect
	Puffer Puffingup DONE
	Puffer Puffingdown DONE
	Twin Twinning DONE
	TwoTouch Activate DONE
	TwoTouch Lock activate DONE
	Less shitty sound names – DONE
	Slowmo versions of all sounds
Visual Effects
	Different Shapes
	Enforcer Activation Effect
Edit config usage to reflect that neo is not the only player
Maybe have players be arraylist?
Something to help get ball out of corners/away from walls, prevent rapid bounceback or getting stuck in a corner
Dash trail end nub not drawn correctly? DONE Problem with ints
Width of kick trail not consistently aesthetic – DONE
Make velocity add component only in positive direction – DONE
Twins goal colour bug – DONE
Make TwoTouch rotate in the correct direction – DONE
Make TwoTouch not go through walls in lock DONE
Decide: Should TwoTouch's velocity vector (from the right stick) continue to affect the kick even if the angle is frozen by a wall collision?
Make TwoTouch velocity sticky in lock mode so if you let go of the stick the kick is still powerful, or just have visual indication of what's going on
Add TwoTouch powercircle effects – DONE
Don't create variables in update
Xbox Controller Support
Menus and stuff
	Play to certain time or certain score, have winner screen
	Controller Select
	Character Select
	intro screen
	help/controls screen
	round over screen – winners, score, time etc, menu options
Draw arena differently based on gameMode? – DONE
More game modes
	FOURSQUARE
Squash mode – DONE
Have config variables: goal layout, player x and y halves – DONE
Neon Neon Particles
Slow-mo + effects – DONE
Spinning indicates charge level – DONE
Power coolDown Indicator – DONE
Have velocity of player affect ball trajectory? (not just position)? Spin – orthogonal vel becomes acc? – DONE. Not sure how efficable in regular gameplay
ball trail?
Load configs: Air hockey, soccer – DONE
Have slowdown factor be part of config?
Make Player abstract – DONE
Player On Player Collision handling – DONE
Make KickCoolDown only a visual effect, and have kicking basically be instant – DONE
make setPlayer set the whole array of players, for case of 4P – DONE
Make actioncam less intense
	Have targets for pos and scale but ease into them much more gradually  – DONE
	Increase size of bounding box DONE

BUG: Game crash on charge trailing ball into goal
BUG: Thetatargets tend towards pi/2 multiples if stick is neutral
	Might have something to do with one axis leaves bounding box first?
BUG: ball gets stuck in wall sometimes
BUG: can't go in corner in squash for puffer sometimes (Maybe it's that next step would take him into the wall?)
	SOLVED: Changed from "if not out of bounds, move" to "move, if out of bounds, put back in bounds"
bug: ball misses midpoint line
	SOLVED: increase threshold for ball detection and teleport ball SLIGHTLY
bug: ball re-enters arena from not side
	SOLVED: weird out-of-arena bouncing physics, fixed by smarts
bug: ball goes offscreen
	SOLVED: wasn't turning off ball collision while it was being reset to center
bug: if ball is too slow, doing a slowmo will make it freeze. Slowmo will also change ball's velocity (makes it axial)?
	SOLVED: Made ball's pos[] a float[]
bug: ball lurches near walls?
	SOLVED?: made collision code account for rebound (instead of just teleporting)
bug: ball get stuck in walls? ball disappears
	SOLVEDPARTIALLY: turn off acceleration on goal as well
bug: power flash isn't correctly aligned for orange
	SOLVED: Slick2d's graphics uses degrees, not radians
bug: blue power kick goes through orange sometimes (certain distance, not too close, not too far) Probably collision bug
	SOLVEDPARTIALLY: Made the kick vector check the ball's previous position 
	STILLNOTESOLVED: If kick is fast enough and kickrange is small enough, occasionally goes through
bug: If you can move as fast as the ball and run into it repeatedly you'll kick it backward

different players:?
regular – DONE
sucks ball in
tornado
cannon?
two touch – DONE
	lose lock on play collision - DONE
		lock cooldown after interruption - DONE
	sniper/prediction trail - PROTOTYPE DONE
	Getting pushed while in lock should change angle instead of teleporting back. DONE
	Make ball getting kicked away behaviour better? What happens when he's enforcer kicked btw
	BUG: Angle jumps when circling on left stick in lock.
		It happens when you move the stick too fast, it looks like
enforcer - DONE
	faster charge-up and much faster recovery
	Less slippery turning
lightbike dash
	must dash all the way to a wall	hold charge until it pops, if released, charge fizzles. More charge the further the wall.
	faster chargeup time
	dash trail can "catch" the ball for a brief while DONE (NEEDS TESTING)
	slightly wider trail range (but not visually) DONE
	short dash release should not have visual effect if left stick is not being pushed anywhere DONE
	bouncing no longer cancels the gust DONE
	BUG: His dash doesn't change the colour of the goals for squash
twins
	left and right bumper transfer nucleii between twins
	right twin has special nametag
	when right twin is dead it sits there like a bumper with no nucleus, and left twin has two nucleii
Okami
trickster:
	can turn into ball
	can fake kicks with stealthy underkick
