Don't create variables in update
Xbox Controller Support
Menus and stuff
	Play to certain time or certain score, have winner screen
	Controller Select
	Character Select
	intro screen
	help/controls screen
Draw arena differently based on gameMode? – DONE
More game modes
	FOURSQUARE
Squash mode – DONE
Have config variables: goal layout, player x and y halves – DONE
Neon Neon Particles
Slow-mo + effects – DONE
Spinning indicates charge level – DONE
Power coolDown Indicator – DONE
Have velocity of player affect ball trajectory? (not just position)? Spin – orthogonal vel becomes acc? – DONE. Not sure how efficable in regular gameplay
ball trail?
Load configs: Air hockey, soccer – DONE
Have slowdown factor be part of config?
Make Player abstract – DONE
Player On Player Collision handling – DONE
Make KickCoolDown only a visual effect, and have kicking basically be instant – DONE
make setPlayer set the whole array of players, for case of 4P
Less shitty sound names
round over screen – winners, score, time etc, menu options
TwoTouch has a gravitational well? 
slowmo versions of all sounds

BUG: can't go in corner in squash for puffer
bug: ball misses midpoint line
	SOLVED: increase threshold for ball detection and teleport ball SLIGHTLY
bug: ball re-enters arena from not side
	SOLVED: weird out-of-arena bouncing physics, fixed by smarts
bug: ball goes offscreen
	SOLVED: wasn't turning off ball collision while it was being reset to center
bug: if ball is too slow, doing a slowmo will make it freeze. Slowmo will also change ball's velocity (makes it axial)?
	SOLVED: Made ball's pos[] a float[]
bug: ball lurches near walls?
	SOLVED?: made collision code account for rebound (instead of just teleporting)
bug: ball get stuck in walls? ball disappears
	SOLVEDPARTIALLY: turn off acceleration on goal as well
bug: power flash isn't correctly aligned for orange
	SOLVED: Slick2d's graphics uses degrees, not radians
bug: blue power kick goes through orange sometimes (certain distance, not too close, not too far) Probably collision bug
	SOLVEDPARTIALLY: Made the kick vector check the ball's previous position 
	STILLNOTESOLVED: If kick is fast enough and kickrange is small enough, occasionally goes through
bug: If you can move as fast as the ball and run into it repeatedly you'll kick it backward
